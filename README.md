# 1. Posts related to building trust

1. In an industry build on code and incentives, people forget that trust is still the most valuable asset. It’s not contracts or regulations that keep system alive; its the belief that they will work as expected. Loose that, and no technology can save you.

# 2. Post related to chess ( I saw he plays chess and I think this will make people curious what  he is doing + India centric as footer of Chain Risk says India for the world)

1. Started as a chess kid in WB, now I’m betting on tech to outsmart old finance. India’s not just playing catch-up, we’re setting the board. More moves to come.

1. What if AI and Web3 joined forces? 
    
   Imagine AI systems that aren’t owned by any single entity, completely independent, resistant to censorship, and fully open-source.
   This is the power of Decentralized AI,  and it’s arriving faster than you might expect!
    

   Right now, AI giants like ChatGPT and Gemini are run by big tech companies. 
   For those of us building in Web3, the question is: 
   How can we design AI that’s open, decentralized, and true to blockchain values?

How does Decentralized AI actually works?

- Decentralized GPU networks provide the computing power.
- Smart contracts integrated with AI models to enable automation.

The challenges we face - 

- Cost: Running AI isn’t cheap, how can we make it scalable for everyone?
- Privacy: AI thrives on data, how do we keep that data secure?
- Trust: How do we ensure the AI stays fair and isn’t tampered with behind the scenes?

These hurdles need solutions before AI can fully power Web3.

Game changing innovations

- Zero knowledge AI to validate results without exposing sensitive data.
- Federated learning to train models across networks while keeping private data safe.

Real-world applications 

- AI powered models that adapt to market shifts in real time.
- AI driven DAOs , governance that evolves with live data.
- On-chain security powered by AI - spotting fraud, Sybil attacks, and exploits instantly.

AI is set to become as crucial to Web2 as smart contracts are today.

So, I’m curious: 

Where do you think AI x Web3 will have the greatest impact?

# 4. Something Inspiring

India used to be the back office for global tech. Now we are building the products, writing the papers, and setting the trends. 

If you are still thinking small, you’re already late. 

# 5. Something people can relate

Every cycle, people ask: “Why do we need decentralization?”

Then a bank freezes accounts, a platform bans users, or a government prints millions, trillions overnight.

By the time they understand, it’s too late.
